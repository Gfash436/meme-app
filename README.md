## Project Instructions
i) Your major work is to implement the splash screen, login page, sign up page, verify 
page and successfully verify page.
ii) The design team is very strict with their designs and they wouldn’t like you to do
something different from what has been designed.
iii)  It is very important you link all pages up and you don’t have to be extremely 
technical doing that, just allow clicking of the button to lead to a new page.

## How I Developed the App
I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
I used Flutter to create the Application. Flutter is an open source framework by Google
for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single
codebase.
I used the dart programming language to do all the magics in the application. Dart is a
client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform. Dart is the programming
language used to code Flutter apps.
I made necessary changes to some system files like main.dart, pubspec.yaml,
widget_test.dart etc.
I imported a flutter package called material.dart. So I used it by writing, import
package:flutter/material.dart.
I created an asset folder which envelops my logos and images folders in the project.
In the lib folder, I created and added the splash, login, signup, verify, and verified
dart files in it.
I used the stateful and stateless widgets on the files where necessary.
I also used a number of widgets to create my application because in Flutter, widgets
contains arguments that enable develops to implement some certain functions on the app
Basically, everything in flutter in about widget over widgets.
